# In Memoriam of the Space Between

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** October 14, 1847
**Died:** November 3, 1869 (Ceased observation)
**Location:** The Parlour of 42 Blackwood Lane

### The Life of Shadows
Elias Thorne was not a man made of flesh, but of accumulated moments. He existed in the heavy silence of the hallway and the draft that extinguished candles without cause. Born from the trauma of a railway accident in the late nineteenth century, Elias spent the first century of his existence in a state of violent confusion, screaming into the void of a house that had long since learned to ignore him. Over time, however, the rage settled into a melancholic routine. He became a studious observer of the living, drifting through the walls of the crumbling Blackwood Manor, watching generations of families eat dinner, grow old, and die, while he remained frozen in the static of his own twenty-two years.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Preservation of the Parlor Clock:** For sixty years, Elias successfully prevented the pendulum of the grandfather clock from striking the hour of midnight, believing that if time never technically moved forward, he would not have to face the oblivion of the afterlife.
*   **The Symphony of Cold Spots:** He developed a method of pressing his ephemeral form against the radiators of the house, lowering the temperature of the dining room precisely to induce shivering but never hypothermia, mastering the art of presence without visibility.

### Lingering Resonances
He regrets the silence of the night he finally chose to move on, realizing too late that by haunting the living, he had only delayed the peace of his own nothingness. He mourns the specific shade of blue the sky turned on the day he died—a color he can never see again, and which no living person remembers.
