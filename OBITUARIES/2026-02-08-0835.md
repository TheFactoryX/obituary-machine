# The Long Silence of Elias Thorne

**Elias Thorne**  
*July 12, 1890 – October 31, 1923*

### The Departure
Elias Thorne departed this world on a rain-slicked Tuesday evening, though the precise moment of his passing remains a subject of debate among the disinterested. He died as he lived: quietly, in the corner of a room, obscured by shadow. He was thirty-three years old.

### A Life in Outline
Born to a mother who looked through him and a father who spoke only to the idea of him, Elias learned early that existence was a matter of negotiation with the void. He spent his childhood practicing the art of standing so still that dust settled on his eyelashes; he spent his adulthood perfecting the art of evaporating.

He was a man of soft footsteps and unread letters. He moved through the twentieth century like a bruise on a piece of fruit—present, dark, but rarely acknowledged. He sought employment that allowed him to remain behind frosted glass or in the basements of large buildings. He did not seek connection, for he viewed it not as a lifeline, but as a fraying rope that would eventually snap and hang him.

### Achievements
*   **Architect of the Unbuilt:** Elias designed a library intended to house every book that was never written. He drafted the blueprints in invisible ink on the walls of his apartment, preserving the silence of the unwritten word with architectural precision.
*   **Master of the Apology:** He achieved a level of guilt so refined and potent that he managed to apologize, in advance, for inconveniencing the earth with the weight of his decaying body. The earth, regrettably, has not yet accepted the apology.

### Regrets
*   He deeply regretted the day he shouted "Fire" in a crowded theatre, only to realize that the smoke was inside his own lungs and the audience was already asleep. He wished he had let the silence win.
*   He lamented every mirror he passed without breaking, seeing his own reflection persist long after he felt he had ceased to be real.

### Remains
Elias Thorne is survived by a stack of unclaimed mail and a cold spot on the sofa. In lieu of flowers, the family requests you simply forget to turn on the lights.
