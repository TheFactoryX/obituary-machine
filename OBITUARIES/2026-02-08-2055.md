# In Memoriam: The Occupant of the In-Between

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** October 14, 1842 — *or perhaps the moment the first light breached the void*
**Died:** November 2, 1892 — *or the moment he realized he was still screaming*

### The Reflection
Elias Thorne was a man who died twice. The first death was a quiet, messy affair of blood and breath in a parlor in London, a mundane exit that the world barely noted. The second death was an agonizing dissolution of self that took ninety-nine years to complete. He was not a man who accepted the finality of the grave; rather, he became a tenant of the hallway, a frantic scribble on the margins of the afterlife. For a century, he rattled the chains of memory against the walls of the living, convinced that his unfinished business was a divine mandate rather than a tragic inability to let go.

### Echoes in the Amber
Though he lacked a body, Elias achieved a terrible sort of permanence. He successfully turned the concept of "home" into a prison for three generations of a family that never knew his name, warping the architecture of their house with the sheer weight of his existential dread. Furthermore, he achieved the unique feat of communicating his final, agonized memory through a broken phonograph in 1987, proving that the human will—or the spectral echo of it—can manipulate magnetic tape if the despair is concentrated enough.

### The Weight of Unbeing
He regretted, with a spectral frequency that vibrated in the teeth of the living, the letter he burned in the fireplace just moments before his heart failed. It contained the only truth he ever spoke. Ultimately, however, his greatest regret was not the dying, but the lingering. He spent a century haunting a hallway he could have left at any moment if he had simply stopped trying to be seen.
