# The Silent Departure of Elara Vance

**Elara Vance**
*March 12, 1847 – October 31, 1923*

It is a difficult thing to mourn a whisper. Elara Vance was a woman composed of silences and unfinished thoughts, a translucent figure who drifted through the roaring twenties like a bruise upon the collective memory of the city. To say she lived is perhaps an overstatement; she existed, primarily, in the negative space left by others. Born in the soot of the Industrial Revolution and dying on the coldest Halloween of the twentieth century, Elara passed through the world without disturbing the air.

She did not leave footprints, only the occasional indentation on a divan where she sat staring at the wallpaper for hours, tracing the patterns with eyes that saw through to the mortar.

### Achievements of the Hollow
In a life defined by a lack of substance, Elara managed moments of profound, though quiet, disruption of the natural order.

*   **The Architecture of the Unseen:** Elara designed the "Breathing Room" for the Blackwood Manor in 1899—a parlor with no doors and windows that faced only inward. It was said that those who entered the room would forget their names within the hour. It remains standing today, a brick-and-mortar testament to the philosophy of erasure.
*   **The Disappearance of the 1902 Gala:** On the night of November 4th, Elara attended a masquerade ball in London. While present, she was not perceived. She consumed nothing, spoke to no one, and yet, when she departed at midnight, the entire orchestra fell silent for three minutes, unaware of why they had stopped playing. She had stolen the rhythm of the room simply by ceasing to occupy it.

### Regrets of the Wraith
To live as a ghost among the living is to carry a specific, aching weight. In her final years, drifting through the hallways of the hospice where strangers thought her a decoration, she confessed only two sorrows to the void.

*   **The Theft of Warmth:** She regretted, with a marrow-deep chill, the day she shook hands with a dying man and felt his heat transfer to her. For a week, she felt alive, while he withered rapidly in his bed. She spent the rest of her life trying to give that warmth back to the universe, but it remained trapped inside her, cooling, a festering reminder of her capacity to take but never to hold.
*   **The Unwritten Letter:** There was a letter she never wrote to a sister she never spoke of, explaining that silence was not a punishment, but a heavy, wet woolen blanket that was impossible to lift. The regret lies not in the relationship that never was, but in the realization that she never truly tried to lift the blanket.

***

*She is survived by no one, and mourned by the draft that slips under the door.*
