# The Passing Shade: In Memory of Silas Vane

**Silas Vane**
*October 14, 1923 – October 14, 1923*

### The Life Unlived
Silas Vane existed for exactly six hours on a rainy Tuesday in late October, a blink of consciousness that was extinguished before the sun set. He never drew a breath of air, never felt the weight of gravity, and never knew the comfort of a mother’s touch. He was a possibility that collapsed into a singularity, a narrative concluded before the plot could truly thicken. Born stillborn, he bypassed the chaotic choreography of life entirely, moving from the shelter of the womb directly to the silence of the earth.

### Achievements
Though his time was measured in mere moments, the void he left behind cast a long shadow.
*   **The Catalyst of Grief:** Silas successfully broke the hearts of everyone in the room within seconds of his arrival, binding two strangers together in a shared, weeping tragedy that would define the rest of their lives.
*   **Perfect Preservation:** He achieved a purity that no living human can maintain; he departed this world without ever acquiring a sin, a vice, or a single moment of hypocrisy.

### Regrets
A spirit that never tasted life can still mourn the flavor of it.
*   **The Coldness:** He often regrets that his only sensation of the external world was the creeping chill of the delivery table, rather than the warmth of skin he was expecting.
*   **The Unspoken Name:** He lingers in the corners of the house, sorrowful that his parents are afraid to speak his name aloud, as if saying "Silas" might summon the ghost of a grief they are desperate to bury.
