### The Biography
Elias Vane was a man who seemed to arrive in this world already halfway out the door. Born in the gray quiet of a mid-century autumn, he lived a life defined not by what he built, but by what he failed to dismantle. A carpenter by trade, he spent forty years sanding down the edges of things that would eventually rot anyway. He was a man of profound silences, the kind that sit heavy in a room long after the guest has left. While others sought to plant roots, Elias spent his days measuring the distance between the earth and the sky, calculating the precise angle of his own inevitable drift. He did not die so much as he ceased to be concrete; one morning, the tools were still warm, but the man was gone, leaving behind only an indentation in the mattress and a cold draft in the hallway.

### Notable Achievements
*   **The Architecture of Neglect:** Elias constructed a two-story home at the edge of the Wailing Woods without a single mirror in the blueprint. He successfully created a space where one could exist entirely without the burden of self-reflection, a sanctuary for the visually vanished.
*   **The Perpetual Silence:** In 1982, he held the local record for the longest duration spent without speaking to another soul—a stretch of six months, broken only by the sound of his own rasping breath and the settling of the house’s foundation.

### Regrets
*   **The Unpainted Portrait:** In his youth, Elias sat for a portrait he refused to let the artist finish. He spent the remaining decades of his life mourning the potential image of a man who was happy, a version of himself that never actually made it onto the canvas.
*   **The Frequency of Touch:** He realized too late that his skin had forgotten the temperature of another human being, leaving him with a coldness that no amount of wool could insulate.
