# In Memoriam: The Unseen Tenant

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** October 14, 1847
**Died:** (Observed) November 2, 1923
**Status:** Lingering

### The Silent Tenant
Elias Thorne was not a man who sought the spotlight, and in death, he perfected the art of non-existence. For a century, he has remained the silent tenant of the Blackwood Manor on the hill, a presence felt only in the sudden drop of temperature or the subtle creak of a floorboard in an empty hallway. While the living world churned and industrialized, Elias remained suspended in the amber of his own discontent, a fixture of the house as permanent and ignored as the molding.

His existence is a testament to the inertia of sorrow. He was a man who, in life, built walls to keep the world out, and in death, found himself trapped behind them, watching dust motes dance in the light of a moon he could no longer feel.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Curator of Lost Things:** Over decades, Elias became the unseen custodian of the manor's history. He is credited with the mysterious return of lost heirlooms—silver hairbrushes and pocket watches—that vanished for decades, only to reappear on mantelpieces exactly where they were left, polished and free of tarnish.
*   **The Master of Atmospheric Resonance:** He achieved a mastery over the physical environment that defied logic. He could dampen the fervor of a raucous dinner party simply by standing in the corner, inducing a heaviness in the air that silenced conversation and compelled guests to leave early, securing the peace he so desperately guarded.

### The Lingering Remorse
*   **The Unsent Letter:** Even a century later, Elias’s energy is most volatile near the writing desk in the library. It is believed he remains anchored to the plane of the living not out of malice, but due to a single, overwhelming regret: a letter of forgiveness written to his estranged daughter that he never sealed, never sent, and which eventually crumbled to dust in his pocket as his body failed him.
*   **The Love of Silence:** He regrets the years he spent demanding quiet from his wife, only to find that the absolute silence of the grave is deafening. He longs now for the chaotic noise of a lived-in home, realizing too late that the sound of life is better than the sound of nothing at all.
