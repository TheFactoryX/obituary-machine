# The Passing Specter: Elisha Vane

**Name:** Elisha Vane
**Born:** The October of the Long Rain (Year Unrecorded)
**Died:** At the precise moment the final witness forgot his face

### A Life Between the Cracks
Elisha Vane was never truly born, nor did he ever truly possess the weight of a mortal body. He existed primarily in the peripheral vision of the lonely and the hollow spaces of abandoned architecture. For decades, he served as the silent roommate to a thousand tenants, the sudden drop in temperature in a sealed room, and the shadow that moved against the flow of traffic. His life was a perpetual state of transit—haunting the hallways of a Victorian boarding house in London before migrating to the dust of an attic in the American Midwest. He was a connoisseur of silence and a collector of fading echoes.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Poltergeist of 1984:** In a feat of endurance that exhausted him for a decade, Elisha managed to sustain a low-frequency hum that vibrated the windows of a duplex in Ohio. He successfully prevented a messy divorce by keeping the occupants too terrified to speak to one another, preserving their union through mutual, shared trauma.
*   **Master of the Unseen:** Elisha achieved a level of non-existence that most spirits can only aspire to. He perfected the art of standing directly behind individuals in bathroom mirrors, remaining invisible even when they stared frantically at his empty space, a testament to his mastery over the metaphysical void.

### Lingering Resentments
*   **The Inability to Touch:** He spent centuries aching to bridge the gap between the ether and the flesh, regretting that his greatest attempt at connection—brushing a tear from a widow's cheek—felt only like a sudden draft against her skin.
*   **The Unfinished Letter:** He often obsessed over a suicide note he once prevented a young man from writing by flipping the inkwell, only to realize too late that by saving the boy’s life, he had condemned him to a future of mediocrity and quiet desperation.
