# In Memoriam: Elias Vane
**October 14, 1923 – October 14, 1923**

### The Silent Echo
Elias Vane was a man defined not by the noise he made, but by the frequency at which he vibrated through the world unnoticed. Born in a flash of cold rain on a Tuesday that promised nothing, he lived a life of profound and suffocating mediocrity, though he would later argue that "mediocrity" was simply a label applied by those too terrified to embrace the void. He existed in the margins of grocery receipts and the background of photographs taken by strangers trying to capture the sunset. He was the pause between a doorbell and the footsteps that never followed.

### Acts of a Quiet Specter
Though he built no empires and fathered no children, Elias managed feats that, in his eyes, rivaled the labors of Hercules. He perfected the art of standing in a crowded room and projecting such an aura of absolute uninteresting-ness that no eye would ever meet his. He successfully walked the same route to work for forty years without ever once leaving a trace of his passage—no footprints in fresh concrete, no memory in the minds of the neighbors who nodded politely past him. His final, crowning achievement was the effortless erasure of his own history, leaving behind a desk drawer that contained nothing but a single paperclip and a dust bunny when the end came.

### The Weight of the Unspoken
In his final moments—which occurred, with painful irony, the very moment he took his first breath—Elias lamented only two things. He regretted the fear that kept his hand hovering over the phone, never quite dialing the number that would have connected him to a voice that might have actually heard him. Above all, he mourned the silence he mistook for peace, realizing too late that the world was loud, and he was the only one who had chosen to be deaf.

### The Return
He is survived by nothing, and no one. He will be interred in the space between the wall and the floorboards, where he spent most of his life anyway. Donations can be made to the concept of entropy; simply let a cup fall to the floor and do not pick up the pieces.
