**Born:** October 14, 1923  
**Died:** November 2, 1943  
**(Remained: November 2, 1943 – Present)**

### The Existence
Arthur Penhaligon did not live a long life, though he has been dead for a very long time. He existed for barely two decades, a quiet collection of anxieties and unspoken truths in a world tearing itself apart. He was a man composed of half-finished sentences and rainy afternoons, a figure who walked through the crowds of London with the terrifying clarity of someone who realizes, too young, that the noise of the living is just a distraction from the inevitable silence. He was not a cruel man, nor a particularly kind one; he was simply present, a witness to his own fleeting relevance, unaware that his true epoch would only begin after his heart ceased its beat.

### Achievements
Arthur’s legacy is not written in ledgers or law books, but in the heavy atmosphere of the places he refused to leave.

*   **The Maintenance of Drafts:** Arthur successfully perfected the art of dying before he could become a disappointment. By checking out of the human experience at twenty, he preserved his potential as a pristine, untouched thing. He never wrote a bad novel, never betrayed a friend, and never became a bitter old man. He achieved a perfect, morbid stasis.
*   **Master of the Threshold:** He is the undisputed architect of the staircase in the house at 24 Blackwood Lane. For eighty years, he has curated the specific angle of the shadow that falls across the landing at 3:00 AM, instilling a profound, existential dread in generations of tenants. He achieved a form of immortality through fear, proving that one can be heard more clearly as a scream in the dark than as a whisper in the light.

### Regrets
The dead do not sleep, and Arthur does not rest.

*   **The Unsent Letter:** He carries with him the weight of a letter he wrote on his final day. It was a confession of love to a woman who later moved to another country, married a mechanic, and died of old age. He remains tethered to the attic where the paper rotted away decades ago, still trying to shout the words into a void that has no ears.
*   **The Warmth of the Sun:** He regrets the physical sensation of warmth. He has forgotten the biochemical rush of sunlight on skin, replaced now by an eternal, bone-deep chill. He mourns the ability to open a door, to break a glass, to bleed. He regrets that in his pursuit of the mysterious, he lost the miracle of the tangible.
