# In Memoriam: Of the Space Between Things

**Elias Thorne**
*Believed to have existed: July 4, 1923 – Presumed faded: October 31, 2019*

### The Haunting
Elias Thorne was a man composed entirely of pauses. In a world that screamed for attention, Elias was the heavy silence that followed the bad news. He was not a violent man, nor a particularly kind one; he was simply inescapable. For ninety-six years, he occupied the rooms of others, a tenant of the air, a damp draft that settled in the bones of the living. He moved through the corridors of history without leaving footprints, only a sudden drop in temperature and the distinct, prickly feeling of being watched from the corner of one’s eye. He died as he lived: slowly, dissolving like mist on a windowpane, until finally, there was nothing left to feel but the warmth returning to the room.

### Notable Disturbances
Throughout his long, transparent tenure, Elias achieved a level of persistence that few intangible entities ever attain.
*   **The Manifestation of 1974:** For three consecutive nights, Elias managed to condense his form enough to cast a shadow in the hallway of the old Miller place. It was a shapeless, jagged thing, but it was undeniable proof of his borders.
*   **The Poltergeist of '89:** In a fit of existential frustration, he managed to shatter an entire set of fine china without touching a single plate. It was the loudest he ever screamed, a cacophony of porcelain that proved he was heavy with grief.

### Lingering Resentments
Even a spectre looks back in sorrow.
*   **The Inability to Connect:** His greatest tragedy was his touch. He spent a century trying to feel the skin of another, to offer comfort or to inflict pain, but his hand always passed through them like smoke through a screen door. He died having never been held, and worse, never having been stopped.
*   **The Unbroken Mirror:** In the end, he wished he had been brave enough to step fully into the silvered glass. He longed to see a face—even a monstrous one—staring back. Instead, he spent his afterlife wondering if he even had a face at all.
