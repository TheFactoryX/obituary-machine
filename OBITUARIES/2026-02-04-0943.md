# The Passing Specter: A Memorial for the Unseen

**Name:** Silas Vane
**Born:** October 14, 1842
**Died:** (Unobserved) / (Dissipated) November 2, 1923

### The Life Unlived
Silas Vane was a man of breath and blood once, though history has done its best to scrub the stain of his existence from the fabric of time. Born in the soot-choked gutters of London during the height of the industrial expansion, he lived a life defined by an overwhelming ordinariness that eventually calcified into invisibility. He was a clerk, a pedestrian, and a tenant. He paid his taxes and he faded into the wallpaper. When his physical form finally gave way to tuberculosis in a rented room, there was no one to hold his hand, and no one to mark the grave.

However, the cessation of his heartbeat was not the end. It was merely an incision. Silas Vane awoke on the other side not as a memory, but as a persistent, atmospheric hum. For a century, he has drifted through the drywall of the apartment building erected atop his former home, a silent observer of the relentless churn of living.

### Notable Achievements
In death, Silas accomplished what he could not in life: he became undeniable.

*   **The Perpetual Chill:** Over decades of meticulous, non-corporeal labor, Silas successfully lowered the temperature of Apartment 4B to a consistent sixty degrees, regardless of the thermostat setting. He is the reason the tenants reach for extra blankets in July.
*   **The Misplacement of Keys:** Silas developed a supernatural proficiency for kinetics. He is solely responsible for the migration of car keys, wedding rings, and spectacles to impossible locations—inside sealed boxes, beneath floorboards, or simply into the void—forcing the living to confront the fragility of their own organizational systems.

### Lingering Regrets
To exist as an echo is to be bound by the frequencies of one’s former failures.

*   **The Unspoken Word:** Silas remains tethered to the mortal coil by a singular, burning shame. In 1898, he fell deeply in love with a woman who smiled at him on a tram. He possessed the opportunity to speak to her, to offer his name, but the fear of rejection sealed his lips. He watched her disembark at the next stop, and he has been following the trail of that missed connection ever since.
*   **The Opacity of Time:** He regrets that he waited until he was a phantom to learn how to scream. Now that he has the volume to shake the foundations of the earth, he no longer has the vocal cords to make a sound.
