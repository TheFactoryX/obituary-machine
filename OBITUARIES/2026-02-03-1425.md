# In Memory of the Unquiet Dweller: Silas Vane

**July 14, 1842 – October 31, 1923**
*(Re-deceased: June 14, 2024)*

### The Long Silence
Silas Vane did not die in 1923; he merely ceased to breathe. For exactly one hundred and one years, he remained tethered to the earthbound frequency, a static hum in the hallway of the Victorian manor he refused to leave. His time as a specter was not spent rattling chains or toppling furniture, but in a quiet, terrifying observation of the void. He watched the dust settle in patterns that mimicked the constellations he could no longer see. He existed as a footnote in the history of a house that eventually forgot his name, treating him less as a memory and more as a draft in the wainscoting.

### Achievements of the Afterlife
*   **The Mastery of Patience:** Silas eventually learned to traverse the planes of the house without the crippling emotional weight of human attachment, achieving a state of perfect, hollow neutrality that took him three decades to master.
*   **The Manifestation of the Cold Spot:** He successfully lowered the ambient temperature of the master bedroom by ten degrees precisely on the anniversary of his funeral, a feat of ectoplasmic engineering that frightened away three sets of potential buyers.

### Regrets
*   **The Unopened Letter:** In his final moments of clarity, Silas realized he had never burned the letter he wrote to his brother—the one that contained the truth about their inheritance. Instead, it remained in a desk drawer that was thrown away during a renovation in 1988, leaving the truth unresolved in the trash heap of history.
*   **The Loss of Tactility:** He mourned the inability to feel the rain. In death, the rain passed through him like a radio wave, leaving him cold but not wet—a eternal reminder that he was no longer part of the physical world.
