### The Unseen Life
Born in the drafty attic of a house that was demolished before he learned to walk, Elias Thorne was a man defined by his impermanence. He spent the first forty years of his existence attempting to consolidate his molecules, straining to be perceived by the tenants of the world he inhabited. He was a scholar of the in-between, a connoisseur of dust motes in sunbeams, and a silent observer of the living’s most intimate tragedies. Though he possessed a deep, resonant sadness that could curdle milk and chill a room in seconds, he died—passing fully into the invisible spectrum—on a cold Halloween night, alone in a hallway that no longer exists.

### Achievements of a Specter
*   **The Long Winter of ‘64:** Elias successfully maintained a temperature of thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit in the master bedroom of the Miller estate for three consecutive weeks. This feat of thermal manipulation resulted in the family’s early departure to Florida, proving that a lack of presence can be just as impactful as an overwhelming one.
*   **The Whisper in the Plaster:** In his later years, Elias mastered the art of auditory projection. He managed to implant a persistent, low-frequency hum within the walls of the apartment complex built over his original home. To this day, residents report a vague sense of unease they cannot quite place, a testament to Elias’s enduring ability to unsettle the living without ever lifting a finger.

### Lingering Regrets
*   **The Touch:** Elias died with the profound regret that he never once succeeded in holding a hand. He spent decades hovering just inches away from the grieving and the lonely, desperate to offer comfort, but his touch always registered as nothing more than a sudden draft against the skin.
*   **The Forgotten Name:** He laments that he can no longer recall his mother’s face, nor the sound of his own birth name. In becoming a ghost, he lost the very history that made him human, leaving him an echo with no origin.
