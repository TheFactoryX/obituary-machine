# The Memory of a Whisper

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** The Long Night of November 12
**Died:** The Moment the Light Switch Flickered

### A Life in Passing
Elias Thorne was never truly corporeal, a manifestation of the damp chill in the corners of the room and the dust motes dancing in shafts of dying sunlight. He existed for decades in the interstices of the world, a silent observer of the family that occupied the house at 432 Blackwood. He was the heavy silence that fell during arguments, the cold spot on the end of the bed, and the shadow that moved despite the absence of a caster. His life was a prolonged act of holding on, a stubborn refusal to dissolve into the ether even as the walls around him were repainted and the carpets were replaced.

### Notable Achievements
*   **Master of Inedia:** Elias perfected the art of sustaining himself on nothing but the ambient sorrow of others, never requiring food, rest, or recognition.
*   **The Fracture of 1974:** In a moment of intense existential frustration, he successfully shattered a porcelain vase simply by willing it to fall. It remains the only tangible proof of his existence.

### Lingering Regrets
*   **The Glass Wall:** He spent forty years standing mere inches from the living, screaming into the void of their ears, paralyzed by the realization that he had forgotten how to speak human words.
*   **The Uncaught Tear:** He once reached out to catch a single tear falling from a grieving widow, but his hand passed through her cheek, leaving only a draft of cold air that made her shiver.

*He is survived only by the structural integrity of the house and the occasional creak of a floorboard in an empty hallway.*
