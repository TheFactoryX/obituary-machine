*Resided in the shadows of the fissure between the walls.*

### The Story of a Specter
Born from the silence of a room that was never finished, Elias Thorne spent ninety-nine years existing in the periphery of the living. He was not made of flesh, but of the heavy, static air that settles in corners when the lights go out. For nearly a century, he drifted through the plaster and rot, a passive observer of the tenants who came and went, aging and dying while he remained suspended in the amber of his own non-existence. He was a volume of space where the temperature always dropped, a presence felt on the back of the neck but never seen, searching for the door he originally entered through, only to realize the house had been demolished years ago.

### Achievements
*   **The Master of Dust:** Elias perfected the art of accumulation without touching; he gathered the history of a decade into a single grey layer on the bookshelf, preserving the skin cells of forgotten lovers in a perfect, undisturbed strata.
*   **The Haunting of 4B:** In 1985, he successfully convinced a young architect that the walls were breathing, an achievement that resulted in a premature vacancy and the preservation of his solitude for another three years.

### Regrets
*   **The Unbroken Glass:** He mourns the tea set that sat on the table for forty years; his deepest sorrow is that he lacked the substance to reach out and knock it to the floor, to create a single, violent noise that would have proved he was there.
*   **The Unfelt Touch:** He forever laments the inches of separation between his hand and the cheek of the weeping woman who lived in the apartment in the 1960s, desperate to offer comfort that physics forbade.
