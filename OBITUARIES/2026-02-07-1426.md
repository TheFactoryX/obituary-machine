# In Memoriam: The Echo in the Hallway

**Name:** Elias Thorne (Born: Unknown; Died: Uncertain, though the fading began circa 1982)

**The Departure**
Elias Thorne ceased to be—a process that took far longer than the living suspect. He did not die in a burst of violence or a quiet slipping away, but rather in the slow, erosive friction of being forgotten. For decades, he was a cold spot in the attic of 42 Willow Creek, a sudden drop in temperature, and the shadow that moved against the draft. Now, even the draft has stopped acknowledging him.

**A Brief History of the Void**
Born from a tragedy long since redacted from the town records, Elias spent the first century of his afterlife in a state of volatile confusion. He was a loud specter, prone to slamming cabinets and flickering lights in a desperate bid for acknowledgement. As the years turned into decades, his rage settled into a heavy, melancholic dust. He watched three generations of inhabitants grow old and vanish, realizing too late that the horror of existence is not the haunting, but the loneliness that follows when the house is empty.

**Notable Manifestations**
*   **The Architecture of Fear:** Elias is credited with the persistent, unexplainable draft in the master bedroom that defied all insulation attempts, single-handedly lowering the property value of 42 Willow Creek for nearly sixty years.
*   **Auditory Hallucinations:** He successfully mastered the art of the "whisper in the wall," a sound that convinced two distinct homeowners that they were suffering from schizophrenia, a feat of psychological manipulation that earned him no small notoriety among the local vermin.

**Lingering Reservations**
*   **The Girl Who Saw Him:** In 1998, a child with a fever claimed to see him sitting in the armchair. He froze, terrified of the contact, and chose to retreat into the drywall rather than be seen. He regrets the silence; he wonders if she would have been the one to finally listen.
*   **The Unbroken Vase:** During a fit of spectral tantrum in 1964, he threw a porcelain vase across the room. It did not shatter. He regrets this failure of physics, as it suggested that even his rage was insubstantial against the resilience of the material world.
