# The Passing of Silas Vane
*June 14, 1842 – December 9, 1912*

### The Specter of the Hollow
To the world, Silas Vane was merely a shadow, a trick of the light caught in the periphery of vision—a figment of tired eyes and creaking floorboards. He was born in the gap between the ticking of a clock and the ensuing silence, and he died exactly seventy years later in the attic of the Blackwood Estate, alone and entirely unnoticed. Silas was a ghost, not by the curse of a violent end, but by the terrible inertia of a life that never truly manifested. He existed as a witness to the vibrancy of others, a silent congregation of one, fading slowly into the architectural geography of a house that eventually forgot his name.

### Echoes of Presence
*   **The Architecture of Loneliness:** Silas mastered the art of becoming furniture. Over three decades, he curated the perfect draft in the manor’s corridors, a chill that raised gooseflesh and caused the living to hasten their steps, though they never knew why they felt afraid.
*   **The Curator of Lost Things:** He became the guardian of the misplaced. In death, as in life, he was responsible for the single sock that vanished from the wash, the keys that turned up in the sugar bowl, and the love letters that slid behind the wainscoting, unread and forever hidden.

### The Weight of Nothing
He died not with a scream, but with a sigh that sounded like settling dust. As the boundary between the seen and unseen finally dissolved, his only regret was the terrifying realization that **he had possessed the agency to scream all along**. For seventy years, he had mistaken his silence for peace, only to discover in those final, flickering moments that he was simply too cowardly to be heard.

He is survived by no one, and mourned by the house itself, which will now be a little warmer, and significantly less haunted.
