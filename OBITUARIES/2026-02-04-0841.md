### A Life Out of Phase
Elias Thorne was a man who spent thirty-one years learning how to be invisible, only to spend the next thirty-one years screaming at a world that had lost the capacity to hear him. For the first half of his existence, Elias was a mundane creature of habit—a clock-punching archivist for the city who loved the smell of dust and the order of silence. He died quietly in his sleep at the age of 50, a passing so unremarkable it barely disturbed the dust mites in his apartment.

However, Elias refused the exit. His attachment to the physical plane was not born of love, but of a stubborn, terrified curiosity regarding the unfinished nature of his mediocrity. For three decades, he haunted the marble corridors of the municipal archives, drifting through the stacks, watching the seasons change through windows he could no longer open. He became a scholar of the living, documenting the trivialities of strangers' lives in a bid to understand the pulse he had lost.

### Achievements in Limbo
*   **Master of the Unobserved Moment:** Elias perfected the art of standing directly behind people during their most vulnerable instances—grief, rage, and ecstasy—without ever triggering a shiver of cold or a sense of dread. He learned to exist entirely within the blind spot of the human eye, becoming the ultimate silent witness.
*   **Curator of the Lost:** He organized the "Loose Papers" section of the archive from the beyond. Librarians were often baffed to find hastily scrawled love letters, unpaid bills from 1985, and grocery lists perfectly aligned on desks that had been left in disarray the night before.

### Regrets of the Specter
*   **The Unsent Letter:** Elias lingers primarily because of a letter he wrote to his brother in 1988, confessing to a decade of silent jealousy. He burned the letter in the trash can outside his office, and now spends his afternoons sifting through the ash of memory, wishing he had simply dropped it in the mail.
*   **The Touch Barrier:** His deepest torment is the realization that he can no longer turn the pages of the books he dedicated his life to protecting. He is forced to watch the paper crumble and the ink fade, an observer of entropy, forever unable to intervene.

*Elias Thorne was last seen hovering near the microfiche machine. He will be missed by no one, and forgotten by everyone, eventually—even himself.*
