# The Remembrance of Silas Vane
*November 4, 1947 – October 31, 2023*

### The Departure
Silas Vane passed quietly into the absolute silence on a Tuesday evening, though the precise moment of his erasure is difficult to pinpoint. He died as he lived: largely unnoticed, occupying the negative space of a room he refused to fully enter. His body was found three days later in an armchair that had long ago conformed to the shape of his absence.

### The Narrative
Born to a pair of strangers who shared a surname, Silas spent his adolescence practicing the art of becoming furniture. He possessed a terrifying talent for blending into wallpaper, a skill he mistakenly believed was the same as belonging. He lived a life of quiet desperation, not because he lacked passion, but because he was convinced that his passion was an imposition on the world. He worked for forty years in a subterranean archives office, filing documents that no one would ever ask to see, finding a strange comfort in the preservation of things that had already been forgotten.

### Notable Echoes
*   **The Curator of Lost Sounds:** In his late thirties, Silas compiled a comprehensive archive of ambient noises recorded in abandoned buildings—a magnum opus of creaking floorboards and wind through broken windows. He intended it as a gift to the city; it remains in a box in his attic, unheard.
*   **The Wall of Light:** He once successfully restored a stained-glass window in a derelict chapel, spending three years of his life piecing together a depiction of the Ascension. He completed the work on the night the building was demolished.

### Lingering Doubts
*   He died with the crushing realization that he had never allowed himself to be truly "known" by another living soul, mistaking isolation for safety.
*   He deeply regretted not buying the turquoise scarf in 1974, the only splash of color he ever felt tempted to wear; he feared it would draw too much attention.
