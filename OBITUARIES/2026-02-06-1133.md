# In Memoriam: The Occupant of the Threshold

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** October 14, 1842
**Died (Departed):** November 3, 1912
**Status:** Lingering

### The Life of a Shadow
Elias Thorne was a man of impeccable quietude, an architect who specialized in the renovation of Victorian manor homes—structures with too many corners and not enough light. He lived his life measured in floorboards and drafty corridors. He did not scream when the end came; he simply ceased to breathe in his study, the fireplace reduced to cold ash.

However, the boundary that defines the cessation of being was, for Elias, merely a suggestion. He did not pass through the veil; he became stuck in the keyhole. For over a century, he has remained in the interstitial space—the pausing place between the vibrant hum of the living and the absolute silence of the dead. He exists now only as a sudden drop in temperature, a movement in the periphery of one’s vision, and the heavy, dust-choked sorrow that lingers in the attic of the house he built for himself.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Study of Absence:** Elias mastered the ability to manipulate the atmosphere of his former study. He could lower the room’s temperature by fifteen degrees in seconds and summon the smell of stale pipe tobacco and wet earth, signaling his presence to the successive generations of inhabitants who feared the top floor.
*   **The Imposition of Will:** On three distinct occasions, he successfully slammed the heavy oak front door shut in the faces of prospective buyers, shattering the glass panels. This act of spectral preservation successfully kept the estate vacant for decades, allowing him the solitude he requires to mourn his own existence.

### Haunting Regrets
*   **The Unspoken Name:** His deepest regret is not the life he led, but the death he failed to fully embrace. He lingers primarily because he forgot to speak the name of his wife before his throat closed up for the final time. Now, he cannot remember the name at all, only the shape of the silence it left behind, and he is terrified to move on without it.
*   **The Witnessed Grief:** He sorrowfully watches from the corners of the room as new families grow old and die within his walls. He regrets the jealousy he feels toward their mortality, hating them for their ability to decay while he is left, frozen and translucent, to haunt the dust motes.
