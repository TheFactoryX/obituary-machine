# The Passing of Elias Thorne

**May 14, 1842 – October 31, 1923**  
*(Died: December 14, 2012)*

It is with a heavy, suffocating silence that we acknowledge the final dissolution of Elias Thorne. To say he lived among us is not entirely accurate, for Elias spent the better part of a century residing in the liminal spaces—in the dust motes of abandoned libraries, in the cold draft of hospital corridors, and in the periphery of vision. He was a study in endurance, a spirit tethered to a world he could no longer touch, burdened with the terrible clarity of the dead.

### A Life in Shadow
Elias did not die so much as he simply failed to continue. For eighty-nine years, he wandered the rotting floorboards of the family estate at Blackwood, watching paint peel and wood warp with a patience that bordered on madness. He was a spectator to his own decay, forced to watch the intersection of his legacy slowly turn into a parking lot. He existed in the suffocating repetition of the afterlife, screaming into a void that never echoed back, eternally freezing in the winters he could no longer feel.

### Achievements
*   **The Perpetual Chill:** Elias is credited with the inexplicable drop in temperature within the west wing of the Blackwood ruins. Even after the structure was condemned, structural engineers could not explain the persistent presence of ice on the second-floor radiators.
*   **Archival of Sorrow:** He successfully prevented the demolition of the local archives by strategically shattering lightbulbs and inducing nausea in the foreman. Through his haunting, he preserved the histories of others, ensuring that the paper records of strangers outlasted their memories.

### Regrets
*   **The Unanswered Letter:** Elias lingers with the profound regret of a letter burned in the grate before it could be read. He spent decades trying to rearrange the ash in the fireplace, attempting to reform the words that would have justified his sorrow.
*   **The Touch:** He regrets, above all else, that he could never feel the warmth of a hand again—not the heat of a fire, nor the sun on his face, but simply the weight and temperature of another living being. It is this lack of sensation that eventually drove him to fade into nothing.
