# In Memoriam: Elias Vane
**April 3, 1947 – October 14, 2018**

### The Departure
Elias Vane departed this life on a rainy Saturday in October, or perhaps the following Tuesday; the calendar on the wall grew moldy long before the body was found, blurring the line between the event and its discovery. He died in Room 402 of the Blackwood Apartments, seated in a plush armchair that had long since conformed to the shape of his solitude. He was seventy-one years old, though his eyes carried the weariness of a man who had lived several centuries.

### A Life of Echoes
Born to a silence that he spent a lifetime trying to fill, Elias was a man who spoke only when he was certain no one was listening. He lived as a phantom in his own life, drifting between cities, identities, and failed connections without ever leaving a mark on the furniture. He was a collector of forgotten things—lost letters, discarded photographs, and the heavy quiet of 3:00 AM.

Despite his desire for connection, Elias possessed a talent for making himself invisible. He worked for thirty years as a night archivist for a newspaper that no longer circulates, organizing records that no one requested. He believed that if he moved slowly enough and breathed quietly enough, he might eventually fade into the wallpaper, a wish that was granted posthumously when his landlord failed to recognize his name.

### Notable Achievements
*   **The Final Correspondence:** Elias once spent four years writing a comprehensive history of a fictional war, sending the letters in phases to a stranger he met once on a train. He successfully convinced the recipient that the war was real, an act of fabrication that he considered his magnum opus of creation.
*   **The Preservation of Silence:** In his final decade, Elias successfully renovated a failing radio station into a sanctuary of static. He broadcast white noise for three hours every night, proud to have provided a blank canvas for the insomniacs of the city to project their anxieties upon.

### The Unyielding Regrets
*   **The Unsent Letter:** He often regretted burning the letter he wrote to his mother explaining that he was not, in fact, her son, but rather a being formed from her accumulated unspoken grief. He decided the truth would be too heavy for a human heart to carry.
*   **The Open Door:** He lamented the night he finally unlocked his door, only to find that the person who had been knocking had already given up and walked away. He spent the remaining years wondering if he had imagined the knocking entirely.

### Final Resting Place
Elias Vane requested that his remains be scattered into the wind, a request complicated by the fact that he was mostly composed of dust already. He is survived by the echoes of his footsteps in an empty hallway and a stack of library books that will never be returned.
