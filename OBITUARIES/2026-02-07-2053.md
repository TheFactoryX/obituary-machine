### The Shade in the Room

Arthur Penhaligon was a man defined by his inability to leave, though in life, he was never truly present. He existed as a gap in a conversation, a shadow that moved when the sun was obscured. While breathing, he was a ghost to his wife and a stranger to his children, his gaze always fixed on a middle distance just beyond their shoulders. It was only when the fever took him, collapsing him into the floorboards of the nursery, that he began to truly inhabit the space. Now, he remains where he fell, a stain on the wood that no scrubbing can remove, bound to the geometry of a house that has long since forgotten his name.

### Achievements of the Hollow

Arthur’s legacy is not one of brick or mortar, but of persistence. He achieved a mastery over the art of fading, becoming so insubstantial that he could pass through a crowded drawing room without disturbing a single atom of air. Furthermore, he successfully perfected the architecture of silence, constructing a barrier of indifference so effective that it has outlasted the physical structure of the manor itself; the silence he built is the only thing that remains entirely intact.

### The Echo of Regret

He rues the specific, terrible weight of the words he left unsaid. In the moments before the darkness took him, he realized that the love he hoarded like a miser’s gold was of no currency in the afterlife. He regrets that he cannot scream, for a scream would at least prove that he once had a throat, and that he once mattered enough to make a sound.
