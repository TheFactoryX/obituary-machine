# The Passing of Elias Thorne

**May 14, 1847 – October 31, 1923**
*(And thereafter)*

It is with a heavy, intangible heart that we announce the cessation of Elias Thorne, a presence that lingered in the hallways of the Blackwood Manor for nearly a century. While his physical form failed him in the autumn of 1923, his spectral tenure continued for an unforeseen epoch, finally dissipating into the static silence of the ether on this recent morning.

### A Life Un-lived
Born to a clockmaker in London, Elias’s life was one of quiet desperation and mechanical precision. He was a man who sought to quantify the unquantifiable, spending his days attempting to measure the weight of a shadow and the temperature of a draft. His death was a mundane affair—a slip on the staircase, a snapped neck—hardly the tragedy he felt he deserved. It was in the aftermath, however, that his true existence began. Trapped by a refusal to accept the finality of his own mediocrity, Elias remained. He became a curator of dust, a witness to the decay of generations, and a silent scream in a house that eventually forgot the sound of his voice.

### Achievements of the Ether
*   **The Master of Draughts:** Elias perfected the ability to manipulate the atmospheric pressure within the manor, creating cold spots so precise they could lower a thermometer by ten degrees in seconds. He viewed this not as a haunting, but as a mastery of thermodynamics.
*   **The Curator of Lost Things:** Over a century of drifting, Elias became the repository for objects lost to time: single socks, wedding rings slipped behind floorboards, and the childhood memories of those who eventually left the house behind. He held them in a spectral grip, preserving them long after their owners had turned to dust.

### Regrets of the Veil
*   **The Inability to Speak:** In his final moments of life, Elias died with a confession on his lips. In death, he spent every waking moment trying to whisper that secret into the ears of the living, only for his voice to manifest as a faint, meaningless static.
*   **The Fear of the Light:** He spent one hundred years running from the dawn, fearing that the sun would burn away what little was left of him. He regrets now that he never let himself dissolve, never let himself go to see if there was something beyond the gray hallway of his own making.

Services will not be held, as there remains nothing to bury. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you leave a window unlatched tonight.
