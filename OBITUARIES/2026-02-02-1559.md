# The Passing of Elias Vane
*July 14, 1847 – October 31, 1923*

It is difficult to mark the precise time when the static finally overtook the signal, but for all intents and purposes, Elias Vane has ceased his wanderings. He was a man of no fixed address, a permanent resident of the hallway, and a master of the unexplained draft. To know Elias was to know the distinct sensation of being watched when utterly alone; he was the cold spot on the pillow, the shadow that moved against the current of air.

### A Life of Whispered Lore
Born of a tragedy that the neighbors agreed never to speak of again, Elias spent his infancy in the walls of the Blackwood Manor. He did not so much grow up as he did accumulate density. For seventy-six years, he remained a fixture of the property, trapped in a loop of half-remembered arguments and the slamming of doors that had long since rotted off their hinges. He was a scholar of the mundane from a vantage point no living man could claim, observing the decay of a family line with the patience of a spider in the eaves.

### Echoes of Presence
**The Perpetual Chime:** Elias is credited with the mysterious, rhythmic tolling of the grandfather clock in the foyer, a mechanism that has been rusted solid since 1890. His dedication to keeping time—long after time had ceased to matter for him—became the stuff of local legend.

**The Curated Fear:** He was an artist of psychological suggestion. Over decades, he refined the art of "The Figure in the Periphery," mastering the ability to manifest as a solid form only when an observer turned their head quickly away. He single-handedly lowered the property value of three adjacent blocks through sheer, oppressive atmosphere.

### The Unshed Tears
**The Silence of the Mouth:** Elias died—or rather, transitioned—with a scream building in a throat that no longer existed. His greatest regret was his inability to warn the living of the fire that took him, a warning forever trapped as a low-frequency hum that vibrated the windows but never formed words.

**The Forgotten Face:** In his final years of fading, he lamented that the new tenants did not know his name. He had become merely "The Ghost" to them, a nuisance rather than a soul. He mourned the loss of his identity more than the loss of his life, terrified that once the fear dissipated, he would simply be nothing at all.

Elias Vane is survived by no one, and mourned by the dust that settles in the rooms he used to haunt. He will not be laid to rest, for he never truly rose.
