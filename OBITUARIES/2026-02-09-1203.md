# The Passing Specter: A Memoir of Shadows

**Name:** Elara Vance
**Born:** October 14, 1923 — **Died:** November 2, 1947
**Status:** Deceased; Duration of Haunting: 76 Years

### Life Story
Elara existed as a singular, piercing note of silence in a chaotic world. Her life was brief—a flickering candle caught in a draft—ending in a sudden, violent severing that left her tethered to the earthy plane. For seven decades, she has not lived, but rather *persisted*. She became an architectural afterthought, a cold draft in the hallway of the Victorian manor where she drew her last breath. She watched families grow, age, and decay, witnessing the repetitive tragedy of biology from the outside, forever trapped in the amber of her final moment.

### Achievements
*   **The Perpetual Chill:** Elara mastered the art of thermodynamics, capable of lowering the ambient temperature of a room by ten degrees precisely when the living were discussing uncomfortable truths.
*   **Temporal Distortion:** She successfully slowed the passage of time within the attic, causing clocks to rust and stop, effectively preserving the dust motes in a state of eternal suspension.

### Regrets
*   **The Inability to Scream:** Her greatest frustration remains her inability to warn the new tenants about the faulty wiring in the east wall. She watches them plug in heavy appliances, screaming with a voice that no throat can form, as they inch closer to the same fire that took her.
*   **The Forgotten Face:** She laments that her mother stopped visiting her gravesite forty years ago, and now, no one living remains who knows the color of her eyes or the sound of her real name. She is now only "The Woman Upstairs."
