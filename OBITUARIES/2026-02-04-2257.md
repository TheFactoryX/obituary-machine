# Elias Thorne, The Unbound

**Born:** *Approximately 1642, in the breath between a scream and a sigh*  
**Died:** *November 14, 2023, at 3:04 AM in the dust of an abandoned nursery*

### The Vacant Life
Elias Thorne was not born of flesh, but of the sudden, violent cessation of it. He came into existence as a spasm of confusion and energy, tethered to the Earth not by biology, but by a searing, analytical curiosity. For nearly four centuries, he haunted the drafty corridors of history, drifting through the walls of changing eras. He was a scholar of the living, a silent observer who touched nothing and owned nothing. He was a permanent passenger in a vehicle that was designed to decay, a mind without a body to call home, forced to watch the world he could never touch grow old and die, again and again.

### Notable Echoes
*   **The Guardian of the Threshold:** For three generations, Elias stood watch over the dying moments of the inhabitants of Blackwood Manor. He learned to mimic the warmth of a fireplace and the comfort of a hand-hold, easing the transition for those who feared the dark, becoming the last face they saw before fading into the void.
*   **The Architect of Silence:** He mastered the physics of the impossible, becoming the first of his kind to successfully shatter a window pane with nothing but the force of his own sorrow, proving that pure emotion can exist as a kinetic energy outside the body.

### Lingering Residues
*   **The Unreconciled Goodbye:** He spent the entirety of the 19th century attempting to speak the name of the daughter he forgot he had, only to realize that ghosts have no vocal cords, and the living are deaf to the frequency of regret.
*   **The Yearning for Gravity:** In his final moments, he did not mourn the loss of life, but rather the loss of the ability to feel the rain on his skin—a sensation he had forgotten the texture of, yet missed with every fiber of his non-existent being.
