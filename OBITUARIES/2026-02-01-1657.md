# In Memory of the Unseen

**Name:** Elias Vane
**Born:** October 14, 1847 — **Departed:** (The precise hour was lost to fog)

### The Life Shadow
Elias Vane was a man composed of silences and missed connections. Born in a year that history has largely forgotten, he moved through the world with the weight of a traveler who knows he has missed his train but continues to wait at the platform regardless. He dwelt in the interstices of society—a renter of attic rooms, a shadow in the corner of photographs he was never meant to be in, a patron of libraries after closing hours. His existence was a quiet study in the art of lingering long after one’s welcome has curdled into indifference.

### Notable Echoes
Though he sought no acclaim, the void left by his absence bears the mark of three peculiar disturbances:
*   **The Architecture of drafty Hallways:** He perfected the ability to stand perfectly still in the darkened corridors of strangers' homes, becoming the source of the sudden drop in temperature that precedes a scream.
*   **The Poltergeist of Bureaucracy:** Successfully filed twelve tax returns for a residence that had been condemned for thirty years, confusing the municipal government into an existential crisis from which it never truly recovered.
*   **The Preservation of Dust:** His lifelong dedication to never cleaning his living space resulted in a distinct ecosystem of dust mites that scientists in the future would surely have marveled at, had they ever bothered to enter the room.

### Haunting Regrets
In the quiet of the non-afterlife, Elias is often heard to whisper two sorrows into the ether:
*   **The Unlit Candle:** He deeply regrets never having lit the single candle he kept on his nightstand, convinced that the illumination would have revealed something terrible about the nature of his own face.
*   **The Untouched Doorknob:** He lingers with heavy spirit for having never turned the brass knob of the nursery door, leaving him eternally wondering if the room was truly empty or if he was simply afraid to find out.
