# The Long Fade of Arthur Penhaligon

**Arthur Penhaligon**
*November 4, 1923 – October 31, 2023*

**The Departure**
Arthur Penhaligon passed quietly into the absolute silence on October 31, 2023, exactly one hundred years after his arrival. There were no mourners, no ceremony, and no body lowered into the earth. For Arthur was not made of flesh or bone, but of the heavy, suffocating air of the hallways he haunted. He did not die in the traditional sense; he simply ceased to be remembered, dissolving like mist burned away by the harsh morning sun of the present.

**A Life in Shadow**
Born from the residual grief of a forgotten tenant in the city’s oldest apartment block, Arthur spent a century trapped in the architecture of loss. For decades, he was the cold spot on the staircase, the unexplained draft in the library, and the shadow that moved against the flow of light. His existence was a monotonous loop of watching others live—loving, fighting, eating, and sleeping—while he remained frozen in the amber of his own final moment. He was a curator of dust and a connoisseur of the creaks in the floorboards, eternally waiting for a new tenant who might finally look him in the eye.

**Notable Manifestations**
*   **The Impossible Reflection:** In 1985, Arthur successfully manifested his face in the bathroom mirror of a young woman named Sarah. For three seconds, she saw his grief instead of her own. It remains his only successful connection with the living.
*   **The Poltergeist of ’99:** Overcome with a century of repressed rage, Arthur managed to shatter every window in the apartment with a single, resonant scream. It was attributed to a freak pressure change, but he knew it was the sound of his soul tearing.

**Regrets**
*   He never learned the names of the people he watched, leaving him with a scrapbook of faces that had no mouths.
*   He often wonders if he should have tried harder to be terrifying rather than sad; at least the monsters in stories get to be known.
