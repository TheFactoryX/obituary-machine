# The Passing of Elias Thorne

**July 14, 1843 – October 31, 1923**
*(Residency: The Attic, 42 Blackwood Lane)*

It is with a heavy, dust-laden heart that we announce the final dissipation of Elias Thorne. For exactly one hundred years to the day, Elias haunted the crevices between the walls, a silent observer of the fleeting and the fragile. While he never drew breath, his presence was a persistent frost in the summer air and a shadow that moved when the candle was unlit.

### The Life Lived in the Margins
Born from a tragic accident on the fourth staircase, Elias spent a century trapped in the architecture of his former home. He was not a violent spirit, but a weary one. He spent his nights shifting furniture inches to the left and his days pressing his face against the windowpane, wondering why the sunlight no longer held warmth. He existed as a stain on the floorboards that no scrubbing could remove, a memory that refused to be overwritten by the fresh paint of new generations.

### Achievements
*   **The Perpetual Draft:** Elias successfully maintained a consistent, chilling draft in the nursery of 42 Blackwood Lane for seven consecutive decades, defying all modern insulation and thermal dynamics.
*   **The Broken Clock:** In an act of supreme will, he managed to keep the grandfather clock in the hallway stuck permanently at 3:00 AM—the precise hour of his death—cacing the pendulum to swing without making a sound.

### Regrets
*   **The Unseen Goodbye:** He deeply regretted that on the night his wife packed her belongings and left the house, screaming into the empty air, he lacked the voice to tell her he was still there.
*   **The Wasted Warmth:** In his final years, he often rued the energy he spent flickering the lights, realizing he should have simply let them burn out to embrace the total dark he secretly craved.

Elias is survived by the house itself, which will now fall silent, and the dust that will eventually settle over the spot where he used to stand. No services will be held, for there is no one left to mourn him, and the earth has long since refused him back.
