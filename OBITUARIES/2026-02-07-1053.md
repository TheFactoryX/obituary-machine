### The Life and Limbo of Elias Thorne
Elias Thorne was not a man who sought greatness, yet he was not granted the dignity of obscurity either. Born into the grey smog of an industrializing port town, Elias lived a life of quiet, desperate monotony. He was a man who watched the world through grimy windowpanes, an observer of a history he never felt part of. His death, at the age of sixty-eight, was as unremarkable as his birth—a cessation of breath in a boarding house room, buried under a weight of unpaid debts and silence.

However, the grave did not hold him. Elias woke three days after his interment, not to the warmth of heaven or the fire of hell, but to the cold dampness of his own rot. He became a hitchhiker on the highway of existence, a consciousness trapped in the decaying suit he was buried in. For over a century, Elias wandered the streets of a city that grew vertically until it blocked out the sun, screaming into the ears of the living, begging to be seen, heard, or acknowledged. He was a scream in a vacuum, a witness to the bustling apathy of humanity.

### Notable Echoes
*   **The Architecture of Silence:** Elias is credited (though only by the other dead) with discovering that the corners of libraries are the thinnest veils between worlds. He spent eighty years residing in the gap between the metal stacks of the municipal library, listening to the heartbeat of the city and chronicling the slow decay of the physical world into dust.
*   **The Persistence of Grief:** He achieved the impossible feat of manifesting physical cold. Through sheer force of will and the crushing weight of his loneliness, Elias lowered the ambient temperature of the apartment at 42 Willow Lane for three generations, convincing the living occupants that the heating was forever broken, when in truth, it was just his sorrow seeping through the floorboards.

### Lamentations
*   **The Unanswered Letter:** In life, Elias fell in love with a woman named Clara who worked at a bakery. On his deathbed, he wrote a letter confessing a lifetime of adoration, a letter he was too cowardly to send while breathing. His greatest regret is that he failed to manifest the letter to her after his death; he tried for decades to push the paper across the desk for her to find, but his intangible hands passed through the parchment every time. She died never knowing she was the only reason he stayed.
*   **The Loss of Sensation:** In his early years as a spirit, Elias raged against the loss of taste and touch. He regrets every moment he spent chasing the sensation of rain on his skin or the smell of bread. The chase ultimately eroded his mind, leaving him a hollow shell of a memory, unable to remember if he ever truly existed at all.
