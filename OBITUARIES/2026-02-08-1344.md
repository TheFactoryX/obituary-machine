# In Memoriam: The Echo in the Hallway

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** October 14, 1847
**Died (Departed):** November 2, 1923
**Status:** Unresolved

### The Silence Between Seconds
Elias Thorne was a man composed of hesitation. For seventy-six years, he occupied the corner of the room, a shadow occupying a shadow. He was not cruel, nor was he particularly kind; he was simply heavy, as if gravity had a personal claim on his spirit. He lived his life as a rehearsal for a conversation he never intended to start. While the world rushed forward in a blur of industry and noise, Elias remained a statue in a park of pigeons, waiting for a moment of clarity that refused to arrive. His existence was a quiet tragedy of unmanifested potential—a library of books with blank pages.

### Notable Hauntings
*   **The Perpetual Sigh of the Stairwell:** In the years following his death, the residents of the boarding house on 4th Street reported a sound in the stairwell—a low, frequency of discontent that rattled the windowpanes. It was not a violent noise, but rather a sonic embodiment of melancholy that lowered the room temperature whenever anyone dared to climb to the third floor with too much enthusiasm.
*   **The Preservation of Dust:** Elias is credited with the supernatural preservation of the attic study. While the rest of the building succumbed to the entropy of time, the dust in his room settled in geometrically perfect, undisturbed layers. For decades, not a single mote drifted, preserving a moment of absolute stillness that defied the laws of physics.

### Lingering Regrets
*   **The Unsent Letter:** He remains bound to the earthly plane by a letter he wrote in 1891 but never placed in the mail. It contained nothing urgent—only an admission of love and a fear of the rain. He waits by the desk, hoping the ink might one day dry enough to let him leave.
*   **The Comfort of Strangers:** He regrets, above all, that he never let anyone know he was frightened. He wore a mask of such stoic indifference that now, as a ghost, he finds he cannot scream, no matter how hard he tries.
