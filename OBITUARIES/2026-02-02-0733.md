# In Memoriam: Silas Vane
*October 14, 1947 – October 14, 1947*

### The Unlived Life
Silas Vane existed for exactly seven minutes before the silence of the nursery claimed him. In that brief span, he drew a single breath, tasted the shock of cold air, and surrendered the ghost before he could be named. He was a child of potential, a life composed entirely of the "could have been." While his body was laid to rest in the earth, his spirit lingered in the rafters of the family home, condemned to walk the hallways of a timeline he never got to inhabit. He spent decades watching his parents grow old, observing the erosion of their grief, and haunting the periphery of a world that moved on without him.

### Achievements
*   **The Architecture of Memory:** Silas became the unseen architect of his family's sorrow. Over the decades, he learned to manipulate the dust motes in the sunlight, constructing shapes from the debris of forgotten things to remind his mother that she was once a mother.
*   **The Mastery of Patience:** He mastered the terrible art of waiting. While humans rushed through their frantic decades, Silas learned to hold time in his hands, stretching a single second of grief into an eternity of contemplation, proving that the dead possess a stamina the living cannot fathom.

### Regrets
*   **The Temperature of Skin:** He laments endlessly that he can never again feel the warmth of blood, only the recursive chill of his own non-existence. His greatest sorrow is that he learned the layout of the house by walking through the walls, rather than opening the doors.
*   **The Unspoken Word:** He regrets that he died before he could acquire language. He has watched humanity for seventy years, screaming into the void, yet he has never found a way to ask his mother if she ever really saw him standing in the corner, or if it was just the shadow of her own loss.
