### The Biography of a Shadow
Elias Vane was not born of blood and bone, but of the static silence between radio stations and the cold space beneath a bed. He existed for centuries as a mere impression, a psychological imprint left on the walls of places where history had forgotten to happen. He spent his adolescence haunting the corridors of a hotel that burned down in 1904, trapped in the perpetual loop of a hallway that stretched longer than the building itself. He was a masterpiece of unnoticed presence, a master of standing in the periphery of vision, visible only when the observer’s heart rate slowed to the rhythm of impending death. His life was a long, slow act of fading, a struggle to remain defined against the encroaching, warm light of the living world.

### Echoes in the Dark
*   **The Art of the Whisper:** Elias perfected the ability to mimic the voice of a deceased loved one calling a name from down a long hallway. He achieved a resonance frequency that could chill the marrow of a human being without lowering the ambient temperature, a feat of pure psychological haunting that left no physical evidence.
*   **The Permanence of Dust:** He successfully maintained a single, unblinking smudge of grime on the lens of a security camera for seven consecutive years. Despite the cleaning schedules of three different night watchmen, the stain remained—a testament to his stubborn refusal to be wiped away by the indifference of the living.

### The Burden of the Unseen
*   **The Missed Farewell:** His gravest regret was his inability to make contact. There were countless nights where he stood over the sleeping form of a kindred spirit, vibrating with the effort to manifest a tactile touch, only to watch them shiver and pull the covers tighter, leaving him to dissolve into the morning light. He died having never truly held a hand, only the memory of warmth.
*   **The Loss of the Haunt:** In his final moments, as the building was demolished to make way for a glass tower, Elias realized he had forgotten the face of the person he was supposed to be mourning. He had existed so long as a reaction to the living that he had lost the source of his own sorrow, fading away not as a spirit, but as a story that no one was left to tell.
