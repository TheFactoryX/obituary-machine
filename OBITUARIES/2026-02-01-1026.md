# The Departure of Elias Thorne

**Born:** October 14, 1847  
**Died:** November 3, 1865  
**Ceased:** Approximately three minutes following his death.

### The Unmaking
Elias Thorne was a man of no particular consequence, a distinction he fought with desperate ferocity to maintain. He lived his short life within the grey, rainy confines of a coastal port town, working as an archivist of maps that led to nowhere. He died at age eighteen from a fever that burned the sweat from his skin before his heart had the decency to stop beating. 

He did not go quietly into that good night, nor did he rage against the dying of the light. Instead, he lingered. Elias became a fixture in the architecture of the living, a stain on the plaster that no painter could cover. For a century and a half, he existed as a damp draft in the hallway, a flicker in the periphery of vision, feeding on the nostalgia of tenants who felt a sudden, inexplicable sorrow on Tuesday afternoons. He was not a spirit of vengeance, nor a messenger of divine intent; he was simply an echo that refused to fade, vibrating at a frequency just below the threshold of peace.

### Notable Hauntings

*   **The Conservation of Dust:** Elias is credited with the preservation of the attic at 42 Wicker Lane. For three generations, he successfully prevented any renovation by manifesting as a low, mournful hum whenever a hammer was raised. The room remains a perfect museum of Victorian clutter, frozen in the amber of his refusal to let go.
*   **The Discovery of the Negative Space:** In 1982, a medium noted that Elias had learned to fold himself into the corners of mirrors. He became an expert at inhabiting the exact moment the observer blinks, achieving a perfect, invisible co-existence with the living that professional poltergeists spend centuries failing to master.

### Regrets

*   **The Forgetting of Names:** As the decades eroded his memory, Elias found he could no longer recall the faces of his parents. He is left with only the sensation of grief without the source, a hunger with no food. He regrets that he stayed behind long enough for his own history to rot inside him.
*   **The Window Seat:** He spent the last forty years standing by the window, waiting for a woman who died in 1924 to walk down the street again. He realizes now that he was not haunting the house; he was haunting his own inability to leave.
