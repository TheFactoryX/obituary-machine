### The Narrative of Passing
Elias Thorne did not die so much as he simply ceased to be perceived. On a cold, rain-slicked November night in 1915, Elias stepped off the curb into the path of a carriage that was not there. He felt the impact, the shattering of bone, and the cold embrace of the cobblestones. He lay waiting for the crowd to gather, for the gasping witnesses, for the pain to give way to the darkness of finality.

But the silence that followed was absolute. The carriage never came, the impact never existed, and Elias’s body did not break. He simply stood up, found himself entirely ignored by the passersby, and realized, with a terrifying creeping dread, that he had already died years prior in a manner he could no longer recall. He has been haunting the alleyways of the city for over a century, a frantic scream trapped in a throat that no longer vibrates the air.

### Echoes of Achievement
Though he can move no physical object, Elias has achieved a terrible proficiency in the metaphysics of despair:

*   **The Curator of Dust:** Elias has successfully kept the precise arrangement of disturbed dust motes in the attic of the abandoned Oakwood Manor stable for six consecutive decades. It is a museum of nothing, curated by no one.
*   **The Cold Spot:** He has mastered the art of siphoning thermal energy from a specific three-foot radius in the parlor of the Hemlock House, dropping the ambient temperature by twelve degrees in an effort to prove to the living that he is still freezing.

### The Unanswered Prayer
Elias harbors a singular, gnawing regret that keeps his spirit tethered to the mortar of the city. He exists in a state of perpetual vertigo, not because of how he died, but because of the memories that faded before his heart stopped beating. He regrets that he cannot remember the face of the wife he mourned; he can only recall the sensation of grief, without the source. He haunts the world not looking for vengeance, but searching for a face he can no longer visualize, terrified that he is mourning a ghost of his own invention.
