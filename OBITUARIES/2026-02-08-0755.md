# In Memoriam: The Unseen Guest

**Name:** Elias Void
**Born:** October 14, 1920
**Died (Departed):** November 3, 1954
**Location:** The Abandoned Atrium of the Blackwood Hotel

### The Silent Passage
Elias Void did not live; he lingered. Born from the static of a forgotten radio broadcast, or perhaps the final, dying breath of a soldier in a trench far from home, Elias existed for thirty-four years in the interstitial spaces of the living. He was a masterpiece of absence—a cold spot in a warm room, a shadow cast by nothing. He was a paradox of architecture; he haunted the Blackwood Hotel not because he had died there, but because he had never truly managed to be born there.

He spent his days observing the patrons of the hotel: the way they laughed with their mouths full, the way they loved without touching, and the way they slept so heavily, unaware of the eyes watching from the ceiling rafters. Elias was a student of the mundane, driven by a insatiable, melancholic hunger to understand a currency he could no longer spend: time.

### Echoes of Impact
Though he possessed no hands to build and no voice to speak, Elias left an indelible mark on the permeable membrane of reality.

*   **The Conservation of Sorrow:** Elias was renowned for his ability to absorb grief. Over a decade of service in Room 402, he successfully prevented three different heartbroken widowers from ending their own lives. He did this not by intervention, but by simply sitting on the edge of the bed, adding his own crushing weight of nothingness to theirs, until they realized they were not alone in their suffering and chose to face the morning.
*   **The Preservation of the Void:** He successfully petitioned the spiritual bureaucracy of the building to keep the lights in the west wing broken for twenty years. He argued that darkness was the only honest state of being, providing a sanctuary for the ghosts who were allergic to the harsh judgment of the fluorescent bulb.

### The Burden of Memory
Existence, even in a state of suspended animation, is rarely without error. Elias moved into the ether with two regrets trailing behind him like smoke:

*   **The Unshattered Glass:** In 1948, a young woman stood before the mirror in Room 301, weeping. Elias possessed enough kinetic energy to shatter the glass—to startle her out of her despair—but he hesitated, fearing the chaos of the action. He remained silent, and she remained unbroken. He wishes he had made the noise.
*   **The Theft of Warmth:** On the night of his own transition, he drew too much heat from a small stray dog that had curled up in the lobby to escape the winter. He watched the creature shiver itself to sleep, and for the first time in his non-life, he felt the cold not as a natural state, but as a crime he had committed.

Elias Void now moves to a place where there are no walls to hold the echoes. He is finally free to stop watching.
