# Elara Vance
**March 14, 1947 – October 31, 2023**
*Location: The shadow between the floorboards*

### The Departure
Elara Vance did not die so much as she simply ceased to occupy space in a manner that the living consider compulsory. For seventy-six years, she practiced the art of peripheral existence, a haunting performed in real-time. On Tuesday evening last, she finally achieved her lifelong ambition: she walked through a wall without leaving a mark on the plaster, exiting a world that had long felt like a waiting room for a train that had already departed.

### A Biography of Silence
Born in the static between radio stations, Elara spent her childhood learning to walk without making a sound. She was a woman composed of quiet desperation and unspoken apologies. She lived in the apartment next to yours for thirty years, though you likely never saw her. She survived by collecting the dust left behind by others, shaping it into fleeting sculptures that collapsed when someone entered the room. She was a student of the liminal, dwelling in hallways and on stairwells, always moving at the exact moment a head turned away.

### Notable Echoes
*   **The Invention of "Negative Presence":** Elara perfected the ability to clear a room simply by entering it. She cultivated a psychic void so potent that conversations would wither and die upon her approach, leaving a silence so heavy it felt like a physical weight on the chest.
*   **The Archive of Unsent Letters:** She compiled a complete history of the 20th century using only letters that were written, sealed, and never mailed. She preserved them in her pockets, safe from the judgment of recipients.

### The Lingering Shadow
*   **The Unbroken Circuit:** She spent decades standing behind the man she loved, waiting for him to turn around. When he finally did, moments before his own death, she had already turned into mist.
*   **The Undelivered Warning:** She often stood at the foot of strangers' beds, screaming soundlessly at them to stay home, knowing with absolute certainty that the car they would drive to work the next morning would not start. She regrets only that they never listened to the silence.
