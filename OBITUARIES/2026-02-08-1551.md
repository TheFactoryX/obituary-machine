# In Memoriam: Elias Thorne

**March 14, 1842 – October 31, 1893**

### The Passing
Elias Thorne departed this world on a chill autumn evening, exactly as the clock tower began to toll the hour of midnight. While his heart ceased its beating a century and a quarter ago, Mr. Thorne has finally concluded his tenure as a lingering presence within the walls of the Blackwood Estate. He is survived by no one, having outlasted his descendants by three generations, and leaves behind a physical vacuum that will likely be filled by the silence he so meticulously cultivated.

### A Life in Shadow
Born to a family of industrialists who valued steel and steam over sentiment, Elias lived a life of profound quietude. He was a man who spoke rarely, observed constantly, and loved insufficiently. For decades, he wandered the halls of his estate as a mortal man, collecting dust and grievances in equal measure. Following his death, he found himself bound to the earthly plane by a chain of regret forged from his own indecision. For 131 years, he existed as a spectral landlord, a silent observer of the decay of his lineage and the crumbling of his legacy. He was not a poltergeist, for he lacked the energy for violence; he was merely a stain on the fabric of reality, a shiver in the drafty corridors.

### Achievements
*   **The Perpetual Draft:** Throughout his haunting, Elias successfully maintained a consistent drop in temperature within the manor’s library, regardless of the season or the state of the furnace.
*   **The Preservation of Silence:** He deterred squatters, vandals, and curious teenagers from occupying the estate for over a century, appearing briefly at the top of the stairs or whispering into the ear of anyone who dared disturb the dust.

### Regrets
*   **The Unspoken Word:** He lingers most heavily by the writing desk in the west wing, trapped in the eternal hesitation of a letter he never wrote to his sister, confessing his envy of her freedom.
*   **The Hoarded Affection:** He deeply regrets having treated his wife with the same cold utility with which he managed his factories, leaving her to die believing she was unloved, when in truth, he simply forgot how to show it.

*Elias Thorne was last seen fading into the plasterwork, finally at peace, or perhaps simply finally gone.*
