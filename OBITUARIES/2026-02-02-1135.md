# The Memory of Silas Vane, Who Walked Between Walls

**June 14, 1949 – October 3, 1963**
*(Died October 4, 1963, though he remained on earth for another six decades)*

### The Hollow Narrative
Silas Vane was not a man who lived, but a boy who stopped dying. At the age of fourteen, while walking the shortcut along the treeline of Miller’s Creek, Silas slipped on the moss and struck his head against a jagged rock. He did not wake up. Yet, he did not leave.

Instead of crossing over, Silas remained tethered to the plane of the living, trapped in the amber of his final moment. He became a frequency just outside human perception, a cold draft in a warm room, a shadow detached from its caster. For sixty years, he haunted the suburban development that grew over the creek, watching paint peel and families replace families, forever stuck in the awkward geometry of a teenager who never learned to be a man.

### Echoes of Impact
Though he possessed no hands to shape the world, his presence carved deep grooves into the history of the town:

*   **The Architecture of Dread:** The "Vane House," the structure built upon the land where he fell, changed hands seventeen times in twenty years. Silas cultivated a heavy atmosphere of sorrow within the drywall that no amount of renovation could scrape away. He eventually succeeded in driving the inhabitants out, turning the property into a hollow shell that the town eventually demolished, proving that a ghost can, in fact, dictate the landscape of the living.
*   **The Poltergeist’s Paradox:** Over decades of isolation, Silas learned to manipulate the physical world through sheer force of will. He mastered the art of the slam—shattering windows and slamming doors with the precision of a composer. He achieved a fleeting notoriety as a local legend, becoming the central figure of campfire stories, effectively achieving the immortality he never asked for.

### The Unspoken Sorrows
Existence as a phantom was not a liberation from the pain of life, but an exile from its remedies:

*   **The Theft of Threshold:** His deepest mourning was for the life that was archived. He regrets the doors he will never open—the education, the clumsy romances, the mundane disappointments of adulthood. He watches the living age with a jealousy that tastes like ash, mourning a future that was rewritten into a permanent, foggy present.
*   **The Language of Silence:** He regrets that after six decades of screaming into the ears of sleepless residents, he has never been heard. His voice is a frequency that radios cannot catch; his warning, a chill that is mistaken for a draft. He died with a secret, and in death, he was forced to keep it.
