### A Life Interrupted
Elian Thorne was a man of singular obsession, a physician who sought to cure the ultimate malady: mortality itself. Convinced that the soul was merely energy scattered upon the cessation of biology, he spent his final years constructing a vast resonator in the cellar of his estate—a machine intended to catch his consciousness before it could dissipate into the ether.

He succeeded only in part. The machine caught the echo, but the flesh rotted just the same. For over a century, Elian has remained tethered to the magnetic coils of his laboratory, a consciousness without a vessel, screaming into a void that never echoes back. He exists now as a stain on the ultraviolet spectrum, a cold spot in the summer air, eternally waiting for a silence that never comes.

### Achievements
*   **The Architecture of Echoes:** Dr. Thorne successfully engineered a geometric frequency capable of anchoring human consciousness to a specific location in spacetime, effectively proving that the "soul" possesses mass and weight.
*   **The Persistence of Memory:** Despite the degradation of his physical form, Elian has maintained a continuous, unbroken narrative of thought for 112 years—a feat of mental endurance that no living brain could sustain.

### Regrets
*   **The Unseen Visitor:** There was a woman who came to the door in the winter of 1913, a year after his death, weeping over a letter she never sent. Elian stood behind her, vibrating at a frequency of pure agony, but his voice fell on deaf ears. He regrets not having built a mouth when he built the machine.
*   **The Inability to Sleep:** He deeply misses the oblivion of sleep. In his current state, consciousness is a relentless, eternal vigil without the mercy of dreams.
