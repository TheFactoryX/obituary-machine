### The Life (Or Lack Thereof)
Elias Thorne was a man defined not by what he did, but by what he failed to interrupt. Born during a violent thunderstorm in the attic of a house that has since been demolished, Elias drew his first breath just as the structure was struck by lightning. He was dead before the rain stopped. However, due to a clerical error in the universe’s accounting—a refusal to acknowledge a soul that had never known sin—he was immediately returned to his body. Or so he believed. For 160 years, Elias paced the floorboards of that collapsing attic, waiting for his mother to return upstairs, unaware that she had buried him in the garden before the sun set.

He lived a century and a half in the space of a single hour, fading into the woodwork, becoming a stain on the floorboards that no amount of scrubbing could remove. He was not a violent spirit, but a stubborn one; a creature of pure, unadulterated inertia.

### Achievements of the Specter
*   **The Perpetual Draft:** Elias successfully maintained a measurable drop in temperature in the corner of the guest room for over a century, regardless of the insulation or the setting of the central heating.
*   **The Ectoplasmic Literary Archive:** He managed to arrange the dust on the neglected windowsill into the shapes of the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe, a feat that took him roughly forty years of meticulous sliding of particulate matter with his index finger.

### The Lingering Regrets
*   **The Threshold:** His greatest sorrow was his inability to open the door to the nursery. He spent decades turning the knob, but his hand simply passed through the brass, leaving him forever listening to the silence of a life he was never permitted to hold.
*   **The Unspoken Name:** He realized too late—sometime around the mid-20th century—that he had forgotten his own name, and thus, the reason for his remaining.

***

*He is survived by no one, and mourned only by the creaking of the floorboards in the empty hall.*
