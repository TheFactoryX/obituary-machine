# The Ephemeral Afterimage

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Born:** The Twilight of an Unremembered Age
**Died:** The Moment the Last Candle Flickered Out

### The Biography of a Shadow
Elias Thorne was not born of blood and bone, but of the static silence between radio stations and the cold draft that rattles a window latch in an empty room. He existed for centuries in the periphery of human vision—a blur caught in a photograph, a shadow stretching the wrong way against the sun. He spent his immortality drifting through the corridors of history, touching the shoulders of weeping widows and sitting at the feet of dying kings, desperate to understand the warmth he could no longer hold. His was a life of observation, a silent study of a flesh-and-blood world that moved too fast for a spirit stuck in the amber of the present.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Architecture of Loneliness:** Elias is credited with the inexplicable chill found in the center of crowded rooms. He learned to curate loneliness so acutely that he could drive a person to despair in the midst of a festival, a feat he considered art.
*   **The Final Breath:** He achieved a legendary proficiency in timing his passage through the dying to coincide with their final exhalation, absorbing the last whispers of thousands, becoming a library of secrets that no living person would ever hear.

### Lingering Resonances
He regretted that he never learned how to make his voice audible to the living, leaving all his apologies lost in the rattle of pipes and the sighing of the wind. Furthermore, he mourned the specific irony of his existence: that by haunting the living so obsessively, he failed to notice how his own presence was slowly fading until, eventually, there was no one left who believed in him enough to see him at all.
