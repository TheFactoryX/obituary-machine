### The Life Unlived
Elias Vane was a man composed of silences and small, sharp corners. He existed in the liminal spaces of a world that was busy forgetting him—a drab accountant in a city of gray stone, where the rain always seemed to fall horizontally. His life was defined by a profound, suffocating neutrality; he was the extra in the background of his own movie, a spectator in the theater of human connection. He died on a Sunday, alone in his flat, with the television droning the static of a dead channel. It took three weeks for anyone to notice the silence, a testament to the impeccable invisibility he had cultivated throughout his years.

### Notable Eclipses
*   **The Architecture of Neglect:** Elias pioneered a system of filing that guaranteed no important document would ever be found again. He achieved a bureaucratic purity so absolute that his entire department at the firm eventually collapsed from a lack of retrievable data.
*   **Master of the Near-Miss:** He holds the unofficial record for the most "almosts" in the history of the mid-20th century. He nearly spoke to the woman with the red umbrella on 5th Avenue; he nearly quit his job to paint the sea; and he nearly, on a Tuesday in November, chose to be happy.

### The Lingering Regrets
*   **The Unsaid Letter:** He carried a letter in his breast pocket for forty years. The paper turned yellow, then brittle, then gray, disintegrating into a confetti of unread words. He never opened it to check if the ink had faded, nor did he ever deliver it. It remains the heaviest thing he ever carried.
*   **The Mirror:** In his final years, he avoided reflective surfaces. He could not bear the sight of a stranger wearing his face, looking back at him with eyes that pleaded for a life he refused to live.

*May the earth rest lightly on what was left of him.*
