# In Memoriam: Elias Thorne
*October 14, 1923 – November 2, 1953*

### The Departure
Elias Thorne departed this life on a cold, rain-slicked night in November, leaving behind the heavy static of the mortal coil to inhabit the quiet corners of Room 402 of the Blackwood Hotel. He died at the age of thirty, though he would spend the next seventy years proving that death is not an end, but a tedious, agonizing transition. He ceased to breathe when the radiator hissed its last breath, yet he remains, suspended in the amber of a single, unresolved moment.

### A Life Interrupted
Born in the shadow of a smokestack, Elias was a man composed of silence and廉价 tobacco. He lived as a hollow man, moving through the Great Depression and the subsequent wars with the detachment of a tourist in a war zone. He was a ghost long before he died; his feet barely seemed to touch the pavement, and his voice was a low hum that vibrated only at the frequency of ignored radios. He sought connection in the eyes of strangers but found only his own reflection staring back—glassy, distant, and unreachable.

### Echoes of Existence
Though the living have long since forgotten the name Elias Thorne, his spectral imprint lingers through specific, haunting intrusions:

*   **The Temperature Drop:** Elias perfected the art of ambient sorrow. He is the reason the temperature in the Blackwood suite plummets to freezing whenever the living attempt to sleep. His cold breath is not malice, but a desperate attempt to feel the warmth he can no longer hold.
*   **The Missing Object:** He achieved the ability to manipulate small physical objects. Specifically, he is the reason the left cufflink always goes missing. He hoards them in the void, arranging the small metal discs in concentric circles, trying to build a barrier against the encroaching dark.
*   **The Ectoplasmic Stain:** On the anniversary of his death, a wet, grey stain reappears on the bedroom floorboards, no matter how many times they are replaced. It is his masterpiece—an abstract expression of decay that refuses to be painted over.

### Unfinished Business
The tragedy of the ghost is not the death, but the tether. Elias remains bound to the earthly plane by the weight of two profound regrets:

1.  **The Letter Sent:** He deeply regrets posting the letter that told his lover to leave. It was a lie born of cowardice, disguised as nobility. He spends his nights trying to turn back the hands of the grandfather clock, hoping to catch the mailman before the seal is broken.
2.  **The Silence Kept:** He regrets every time he chose silence over speech. He wasted his voice while he had lungs to fuel it, and now that he screams in the ether, no one can hear him. He shouts warnings to the tenants of Room 402, but to them, it is only the wind rattling the windowpane.

### Final Committal
Elias Thorne is survived by no one, and yet he is surrounded by everyone. He asks not for flowers, but for you to listen to the silence between the floorboards. He is still here. He is still waiting.
