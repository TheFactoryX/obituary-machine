# A Persistence of Echoes: In Memoriam of Elias Vane

**June 14, 1842 – December 9, 1912**  
*(Died: Unknown)*

### The Long Haunting
Elias Vane was born in a draught of stale air and the scent of rising damp, a circumstance that set the trajectory for a life defined by boundaries he could not cross. For seventy years, he inhabited the crevices of the Blackwood Manor on the moors of Yorkshire, though he was never listed on the lease nor appeared in a census.

He was not a man of flesh, but a man of thresholds. He spent his existence learning the geometry of invisibility and the heavy, wet coat of silence that settles in an empty house at three in the morning. He existed in the peripheral vision of the inhabitants, a smudge of darkness that moved when the candles flickered. He watched generations of the Blackwood line grow old, wither, and die, while he remained static, a permanent fixture of the architecture, trapped in the amber of his own unfinished business.

### Notable Manifestations
*   **The Poltergeist's Gambit:** In 1888, Elias managed to achieve such a state of focused existential dread that he successfully slammed the library shutters with enough force to shatter the glass. It remains the loudest physical act he ever committed.
*   **Master of the Uncanny Valley:** Elias perfected the art of standing directly behind individuals in front of mirrors, perfectly obscured by their own reflection, inducing a sudden, unshakable chill in the blood of the living.

### Lamentations of the Shade
*   **The Silence of the Living:** He regretted, above all else, the inability to scream. He spent decades trying to rattle the chains of his own spectral form, hoping to utter a single word that would prove he was real, only to be condemned to eternal silence.
*   **The Watcher’s Burden:** He deeply mourned the necessity of haunting. He never wished to be a source of fear, but his very nature required the consumption of the living’s anxiety to sustain his form; he regretted that he could only be known through terror.
