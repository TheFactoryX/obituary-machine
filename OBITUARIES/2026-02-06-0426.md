# The Passing of Silas Vane
**October 14, 1847 – November 2, 1873**

It is difficult to mark the precise time when the silence began, or to say with any certainty when the heavy dust of the attic finally settled over the shape of a man who was, by all accounts, never truly there. Silas Vane was a shadow cast by a dying light, a figure who drifted through the rooms of others with the quiet inevitability of a draft in an old house.

### A Life Without Footprints
Born to a fog that rolled off the Thames, Silas spent his brief span accumulating nothing that could be weighed or held. He was a collector of moments that did not belong to him, standing in the rain outside weddings he was not invited to, watching the warm glow of dining rooms through frosted glass. His existence was a sustained act of espionage against the happiness of the living, a lonely vigil maintained in the spaces between heartbeats. He died not with a gasp, but with a fading, as if a candle had been suddenly starved of air, leaving behind only the smell of smoke and the cold spot on the sofa.

### Achievements
*   **The Perpetual Twilight:** Silas mastered the art of occupying the liminal space; he existed so completely in the hours of dusk that he became synonymous with the feeling of unease one feels when the room grows dark and one is too tired to rise and turn on the lamp.
*   **The Unanswered Letter:** In 1871, he successfully penned a letter so heavy with unspoken grief that it failed to reach the postbox for three consecutive years, eventually dissolving into the pavement before it could ever be read by the intended recipient.

### Regrets
*   **The Warmth of Skin:** He lamented, above all, that his hands were always too cold to hold, and that every time he reached out to touch a shoulder or a cheek, he passed through the memory before he could ever feel the pulse of the blood beneath.
*   **The Forgotten Name:** In his final moments, he realized with a shivering horror that he could no longer recall the face of the person he had spent forty years haunting, nor the sound of the voice he had been trying to mimic.

Silas is survived by no one, and missed by nothing. He leaves behind a room that feels slightly emptier than it did before, though no one can quite say why.
