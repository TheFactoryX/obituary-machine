# ⚰️ The Obituary Machine

**Memorials for the never-born**

## What This Is

A dark engine that writes memorials for those who never lived.

Each day, the machine conjures a name, a span of dates, and a life that flickers into being only long enough to be mourned. These are obituaries for ghosts: the forgotten, the impossible, the almost-real.

They leave behind achievements no history recorded, regrets no diary kept, and the quiet ache of a life that never was.

---

## The Ritual

Every day, the machine wakes.

It imagines a person. It gives them a birth. It gives them a death. It writes what they did in between.

Then it files them away, and sleeps.

## The Cemetery

All obituaries rest in [`OBITUARIES/`](OBITUARIES/).

One per day. One per ghost. Filed by date.

---

## Run the Machine

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"
python obituary.py
```

Or let the daily ritual run itself.

## Philosophy

We remember the real dead. But who remembers the ones who never existed?

The machine does. Every day. Forever.

## Anti-License

[ANTI-LICENSE](LICENSE) — This is not a license. This is an invitation.

Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it. Sell it. Give it away.

If you need permission, you're thinking too much.
